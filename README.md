## 🧰 Prerequisites

* Docker Engine
* Docker Compose V2
* Git
* (Optional) ZFS on Linux for dataset management

> ⚠️ **Note:** These instructions assume your ZFS pool is named `tank`. If your pool has a different name (e.g., `rpool`, `zdata`, etc.), replace `tank` in all paths and commands with your actual pool name.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Create the stack directory and clone the repository**

   If using ZFS:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs create -p tank/docker/compose/registry
   cd /tank/docker/compose/registry
   sudo git clone https://github.com/Vantasin/Registry.git .
   ```

   If using standard directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/compose/registry
   cd ~/docker/compose/registry
   git clone https://github.com/Vantasin/Registry.git .
   ```

2. **Create the runtime data directory**

   If using ZFS:
   ```bash
   sudo zfs create -p tank/docker/data/registry
   ```

   If using standard directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/docker/data/registry
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**

   Copy and modify the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   sudo cp env.example .env
   sudo nano .env
   sudo chmod 600 .env
   ```

   > **Note:** Be sure to update the `REGISTRY_USERNAME` & `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, they are your login credentials. If necessary you can also update the `REGISTRY_DATA_VOLUME`.

   > **Note:** In order to remotely use the Docker Registry we need a trusted certificate from a certificate authority. Be sure to create the **Proxy Host** eg. `registry.example.com` using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://github.com/Vantasin/Nginx-Proxy-Manager.git) as a reverse proxy for HTTPS certificates via Let's Encrypt.
   >
   > **Proxy Host:**
   >  - **Domain Name:** `https://registry.example.com`
   >  - **Scheme:** `http`
   >  - **Forward Hostname/IP:** `registry`
   >  - **Forward Port:** `5000`
   >
   > **SSL:**
   >  - Check **Enable SSL**
   >  - From the **Certificate** dropdown select your `*.example.duckdns.org` certificate
   >  - Enable **Force SSL** to redirect all HTTP → HTTPS

4. **Setup basic authentication**

   Run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x generate_htpasswd.sh
   sudo ./generate_htpasswd.sh
   ```

5. **Start registry**

   ```bash
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

## Push Images to Registry

To push Docker images to your **Docker Registry**, you need to follow these steps:

---

### 🧭 Overview

* You have a local Docker registry container listening on `localhost:5000`
* It's exposed externally as `https://registry.example.com` via Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)
* You’ve added Basic Auth using `htpasswd`
* You want to `docker push` images to it

---

### ✅ 1. 📦 Tag Your Image Correctly

You must tag the image using the **registry domain**:

```bash
docker tag my-image:latest registry.example.com/my-image:latest
```

If you're using a custom port like `registry.example.com:8443`, include it in the tag:

```bash
docker tag my-image:latest registry.example.com:8443/my-image:latest
```

---

### ✅ 2. 🔐 Authenticate to Your Registry

Docker supports HTTP Basic Auth via the `docker login` command.

Run:

```bash
docker login registry.example.com
```

You'll be prompted for the username and password from your `.env` / `htpasswd`.

> ✅ This creates an entry in your `~/.docker/config.json` so Docker can authenticate for future pulls and pushes.

---

### ✅ 3. 🚀 Push the Image

Once authenticated and tagged:

```bash
docker push registry.example.com/my-image:latest
```

---

### ✅ 4. 📦 List All Images

Once tagged image has been pushed:


```bash
curl -u USERNAME https://registry.example.com/v2/_catalog
```
> **Replace:** `USERNAME` with your registry credentials from htpasswd & `registry.example.com` with your domain from Nginx Proxy Manager

---

### ✅ 5. ⚙️ Nginx Proxy Manager Configuration

Make sure your NPM proxy host is configured like this:

| Setting                   | Value                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain Name**           | `registry.example.com`                                              |
| **Forward Hostname/IP**   | `registry`                                                          |
| **Forward Port**          | `5000`                                                              |
| **Scheme**                | `http`                                                              |
| **Enable SSL**            | ✅ Yes (via Let's Encrypt)                                          |
| **Block Common Exploits** | ✅ Yes                                                              |
| **Websockets Support**    | ✅ Recommended                                                      |
| **Access List/Auth**      | **Disabled** (because you're using `htpasswd` inside the container) |

> ⚠️ If you add auth in NPM **and** inside the registry container, you may get **double prompts or errors.** Only use `htpasswd` **inside** the container, not NPM’s access list.

---

### ✅ 6. 🔒 DNS + HTTPS Requirements

Ensure:

* `registry.example.com` resolves to your public IP or Tailscale IP
* You have a **valid TLS certificate** via NPM (Let's Encrypt)

---

### 🐳 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Tag the image
docker tag alpine:latest registry.example.com/test/alpine:latest

# 2. Login to registry
docker login registry.example.com

# 3. Push the image
docker push registry.example.com/test/alpine:latest

# 4. List All Images
curl -u USERNAME https://registry.example.com/v2/_catalog
```

---

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem                                         | Solution                             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `unauthorized: authentication required`         | Run `docker login` again             |
| `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` | Ensure TLS cert is valid and trusted |
| Push fails with 403/404                         | Check NPM doesn’t also require auth  |
| Can't reach `registry.example.com`              | Check DNS or NPM reverse proxy setup |
